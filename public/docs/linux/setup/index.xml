      <description>There&#39;s no place like $HOME~ Below I describe my home folder layout and why I do things the way I do, perhaps you&#39;ll get something out of it. It&#39;s a little excessive, I know, but what can you do? 🤷‍♂

      <description>management  git &amp;ndash;bare repo method as detailed in atlassian tutorial and similar  although I have a clever &amp;lsquo;dots&amp;rsquo; alias   I tried yadm, stow etc but they never really clicked, needed to do it this way to grok it  I don&#39;t want to put a file in the git repo and then symlink it out. I want the file to be in the right place, and simply track it by adding it to the bare git repo.</description>
