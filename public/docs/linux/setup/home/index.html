</code></pre><h2 id="general-notes">General notes</h2>
<p>Liberal use of symlinking and the use of templates are the important bits here. It took a minute to understand how to use symlinks properly, but now they're something of a hammer, and I find nails everywhere.</p>
<p>I took a bit of inspiration from systems like GTD and PARA - not that I'd ever advise getting too into these beyond reading a brief tl;dr, as I find them a heinous procrastination trap. Actually getting to this point involved a bunch of trial &amp; error, setting things up and tearing them down repeatedly (and frankly, involved a big change in character - I use to be far less well-organised in every aspect).</p>
<h3 id="xdg">XDG</h3>
<p>If you want a custom configuration like this and find that some applications make their own folders according to the default XDG spec (~/Desktop, /Documents etc - Firefox is particularly criminal of this), create a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_user_directories">user-dirs.dirs</a> file in your <code>~/.config</code> directory and edit it accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="by-directory">By directory</h2>
<h3 id="archive"><code>archive/</code></h3>
<p>Old or stale stuff goes here. Could be code projects, old documents from Uni or previous workplaces, abandoned tutorials, whatever. I'm loathe to delete things, and this is how I manage it!</p>
<h3 id="backups"><code>backups/</code></h3>
<p>This directory is also symlinked over to my 2nd HDD.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>, which genuinely does do backup right. Highly recommended, easy to schedule with a tool like <code>cron</code> - I use <a href="https://github.com/leahneukirchen/snooze"><code>snooze</code></a> .</p>
<p>I target folders like <code>~/projects</code> - it’s not in my Dropbox because, IIRC, Dropbox can run into trouble with symlinks in a certain direction, and with <code>git</code>. I use GitHub for all my projects anyway.</p>
<h3 id="inbox"><code>inbox/</code></h3>
<p>Self-explanatory - browser, website archiving or media downloads, Github checkouts etc.</p>
<p>I set up a script to give me notifications to clean it up on Monday and Friday evenings.</p>
<p>Currently Firefox can only save to a single folder, or gets the user to select one every time. Someday I'll write a script I can get Firefox to call that matches download filetypes to specific locations.</p>
<h3 id="library"><code>library/</code></h3>
<p>As I mentioned this is just a symlink to a directory with that name on a secondary HDD mounted at <code>/media/data/Dropbox</code> - I have the same-sized SSD and HDD in both my computer and my laptop, so I don't have to think much about selective downloads with Dropbox. One day I'll upgrade to 2TB drives to match my Dropbox capacity.</p>
<p>I'm a data hoarder, and have many, many gigabytes of PDFs, ebooks and documents (surely more than a lifetimes worth already). I use something like the Dewey Decimal System to organise my books sub-directory - it works pretty nicely most of the time, although it's by no means perfect.</p>
<p>For my general reading shelf, I put symlinks to the actual file in the library, and I do the same when I have books or PDFs related to projects. Saves a lotta space.</p>
<h3 id="org"><code>org/</code></h3>
<p>Not much to say. Usually this folder stores documents related to life-admin that I can't simply write and store in Joplin.</p>
<p>When I was playing around with <code>org-mode</code> I stored my <code>.org</code> files here. I want to come back to emacs at some point, but it's a huge time investment with long-term payoffs, and those kinds of costs are best paid for when I have a techie-job to fix my learning priorities, and to give me more schedule and certainty.</p>
<h3 id="projects"><code>projects/</code></h3>
<p>My projects directory is full of projects fitting a template format, where I group code downloaded from related github repos and various documents and screenshots etc symlinked in from my library.</p>
<p>I'll go into the directory structure another time.</p>
<h3 id="wiki"><code>wiki/</code></h3>
<p>Stuffed full of markdown files, but effectively archived - I'm in the process of clean-up and extraction as I type this very sentence.</p>
