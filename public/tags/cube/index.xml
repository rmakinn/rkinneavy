      <description>How To Practice [v1]  The following is copied over from a post I wrote back in 2011 on speedsolving.com. Since then, it&#39;s received about 60k pageviews, which I think is pretty decent for a forum which shrank a lot with the advent of Reddit! I made some small formatting and editorial changes for readability, the content is effectively intact. It&#39;s cubing-centric, but I think a non-cuber can read it and get some value from it with only limited familiarity with the hobby (you don&#39;t have to know how to solve).</description>
