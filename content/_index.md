# Welcome!

to my personal blog & public knowledgebase. 

{{< hint danger >}}
This site is a constant work-in-progress, but right now it's also under more general construction.

Expect changes to structure, layout and slugs (only bookmark the base URL for now - content will mostly be preserved), also potentially temporary periods offline.

## Who?

I'm Rowan Kinneavy. I like all things programming, musical, cuboid, philosophoid, and more. I'm an intermediate with Linux and Bash, and I know a bit of Python, JS and SQL.

If you've arrived here by way of a link in an application of mine, or you're a recruiter, my portfolio is sort of this whole site - but you probably want to look at my [projects (**WIP!**)](./docs/projects/) here.

## Knowledgebase, Huh?

Public knowledgebases are pretty neat, I think, so I'm working on building this one out. Here are a bunch of way better ones than mine (for now):

{{< expand "Notable PKBs" "///" >}}

[Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/)

[karlicoss](https://beepb00p.xyz/)

[h0p3](https://philosopher.life/#h0p3:Root%20%5B%5BAbout%2C%20The%20Opening%20of%20the%20Rabbithole%5D%5D%20h0p3)

### What's here?

- The blog section covers tech articles or more exploratory pieces
- The PKB section is a central repository of concept explanations, links to resources for various things, dev-oriented reference sheets, and miscellaneous tidbits - quotes, poetry and art etc
- The projects section covers technical details and design discussions of software I have written (or plan to write)


### Why public?

The idea is that publishing my notes provides the same benefits you get from explaining things out loud. It's all very well to know something in your personal private language, but actually *knowing* a concept is something else. There are a few bits of writing I'd like to translate from Rowan-speak to general-audience English - hopefully extracting the value (if any) buried within them. 

Also, it's just a pretty nice feeling to go over things and get a sense of how far you've come. It's equal parts funny/horrifying to realise how much you've forgotten, too.

## How its made?

- Go check out the source on my [GitHub!](https://github.com/rmakinn/rkinneavy)
- The site is freely hosted, courtesy of [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
  - Don't worry, they made their $$$ - I pay them for the domain.
- Posts are written in Markdown and generated via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- I'm using a modified version of the [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme.
  - Shortcodes are naturally inherited/modified from [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book), among others.
- Search is currently using the theme default, but I'm working on getting [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) up-and-running asap.
- The fonts used are [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans) and [Courier Prime](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Courier+Prime) for serif and monospace.
- The colour of the text is [Eigengrau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigengrau), `#16161d`, the dark hue many report seeing in the complete absence of light.
- The background color is from Ethan Schoonover's Solarized Light, `#eee8d5`
