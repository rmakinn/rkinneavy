# Welcome!

... to my personal blog & public knowledgebase. 

{{< hint danger >}}
This site is intended to be a constant work-in-progress, but right now it's also under construction.
Expect unexpected changes to structure and layout (content will mostly be preserved), and temporary periods offline.

## Who?

I'm Rowan Kinneavy. I like all things programming, musical, cuboid, philosophoid, and more. I'm a self-taught developer.

If you've arrived here by way of a link in an application of mine, or you're a recruiter, my portfolio is sort of this whole site - but you probably want to look at my [projects](./docs/projects/) here.

## What?

Public knowledgebases are pretty neat, I think, so I'm working on building this one out. I've thousands of notes on my computer. Though plenty of them say similar things or have duplicate ideas - hopefully some will say cool or useful things, and those are the ones *you'll* see, dear reader. 

### What's here?

<--- See the sidebar

In theory, it will eventually be populated with sections on all sorts of things, from documenting my Linux system, to topics in computer science, to philosophy, maths, poetry, rationality, phenomenology, nice recipes, metaphor... etc etc.


### Why public?

The rationale is that publication of my notes serves a similar role to verbal expression, encouraging me to re-wrap things in less Rowan-specific language - clarifying and distilling the contents. 

It's also just quite nice to go over things and get a sense of how far you've come (and also how much you've forgotten, too).

## How?

- It's written in Markdown and generated via Hugo. 
- Go check out the source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/rmakinn/rkinneavy). 
- The site is hosted courtesy of Netlify. 
- I'm using a gently modified version of the [book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme.
