## Concept

- Efficiently organised repository the creator can treat as **permanent**, **central** and **important**
  - metadata
    - tagging
    - search keywords/weighting 
  - hierarchical taxonomy
- Explorable
  - some systems (like Zettelkasten) optimise for idiosyncracy
  - designing for other users to explore adds some initial work/weight but pays off in the long run (someday you as the future reader will feel a very different person to you as the past author)
    - sensible choices in this vein are analagous to good code-commenting practices
