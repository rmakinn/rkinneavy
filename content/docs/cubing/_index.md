## Story time

In 2008, when I was 16-17, my friend Jude showed me that he could solve a cube. I was astonished, and totally jealous. I was just coming out of a phase of stiff competition with one of my mates on Tetris Friends (back when it was on Facebook and it was good) - and had my hard-earned personal best in the 40 line sprint trounced by about 10%. Being the competitive type, and not to be beaten again by another one of my mates, I immediately went to order one and learn. 

I'd taken an interest in it when I was younger, maybe around 12, but only with a picture cube or sudoku-cube (both difficult). When I was ~14 I got a keyring cube, and I seem to remember I figured out that solving for stickers only wouldn't work, and I could solve the pieces. I'm pretty sure I figured out Niklas to solve corners-first. Unfortunately I had a lot of trouble with edges, and my keyring cube was terrible. Like plenty before me, I became frustrated and pulled it to bits.

I didn't waste any time trying to figure the solution out from scratch. I wanted to solve it asap! I learned from Ryan Heise's beginner tutorial [here](https://www.ryanheise.com/cube/beginner.html). It took me several hours, and I had no idea what was going on, but I was totally elated when I finally managed to slide the last layer into place.

> TODO: journey from 90s-45s, fast turning, quick ride down to sub-30, only Jude ahead of me. Awesome memories of team-solving. The feeling of breaking sub-20, deliberately & cognitively passing a mental barrier with how to get myself to go faster, hyper-focused.
