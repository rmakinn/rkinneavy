# Cubing

If you know me you'll know I like my cubes. Below are a few links, and neat things I've done while part of the cubing community. In the sidebar you'll see some tutorials. This section (like the rest of the site) is work-in-progress.

{{< hint info >}}
Several years ago I lost a lot of written content about the solving tips, tricks and techniques I had to share. I didn't want to even think about it until recently, but I recently felt keen to get back to it. Next steps are to update some of my old articles, and hopefully post some fresh content soon.
