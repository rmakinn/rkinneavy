## Notable achievements

- UKNR of 7.71 seconds for 3x3x3 in 2010, peaked at #7 in the database, remained in the top 100 until 2014
- UKNR of 1.18 seconds for 2x2x2 in 2010, peaked at #5 in the database, remained in the top 100 until 2016
- 23 medals and 6 NRs across 16 competitions
    - Made the podium in 8 of 16
        - Alas I'm yet to win one - it's on my to-do list!
- Traveled by myself to Canada/USA in 2010, stayed with friends made on the forums, competed at the US Nationals
    - I'm still penpals with one, David Woner <3
- Developed algorithms for the 3x3x3 and 2x2x2 still in use today
    - One of the first people to learn and develop advanced 2x2x2 solving methods (`EG-1` and `EG-2`)
    - I make a few appearances in websites like [Shotaru Makisumi's](http://cubefreak.net/speed/advancedf2l/)
- Created the `OLS-FE` set of algorithms
- Top 30 in solving the virtual 3x3x3 and 5x5x5 between 2011-2015 on [hi-games](https://hi-games.net/cube/)
    - Uses Java Applets ~ it's now very quiet
- Played a significant part in the development and advancement of modern turning style
- Performed at trade show events with a talent agency
- Wrote influential guides on deliberate practice, and advanced aspects of solving
- Explored the most creative part of the CFOP method to my fullest capacity 
    - I was making use of advanced techniques (pair priority, multi-slotting, pseudo-slotting) years before many of my peers 
        - Although with too many notable exceptions to mention!
    - In retrospect, I think my focus on movecount and elegance was for aesthetic purposes, but the view I held at the time was that it was the only route to getting faster
        - I'm much more pragmatic these days
- Grinded hard. My peak volume of practice seems ridiculous to me now 
    - for months I was putting in monster sessions, solving 500+ cubes per day
    - I think my record in a single day was ~1300


## Story time

In 2008, when I was 16-17, my friend Jude showed me that he could solve a cube. I was astonished, and totally jealous. I was just coming out of a phase of stiff competition with one of my mates on Tetris Friends (back when it was on Facebook and it was good) - and had my hard-earned personal best in the 40 line sprint trounced by about 10%. Being the competitive type, and not to be beaten again by another one of my mates, I immediately went to order one and learn. 

I'd taken an interest in it when I was younger, maybe around 12, but only with a picture cube or sudoku-cube (both difficult). When I was ~14 I got a keyring cube, and I seem to remember I figured out that solving for stickers only wouldn't work, and I could solve the pieces. I'm pretty sure I figured out Niklas to solve corners-first. Unfortunately I had a lot of trouble with edges, and my keyring cube was terrible. Like plenty before me, I became frustrated and pulled it to bits.

I didn't waste any time trying to figure the solution out from scratch. I wanted to solve it asap! I learned from Ryan Heise's beginner tutorial [here](https://www.ryanheise.com/cube/beginner.html). It took me several hours, and I had no idea what was going on, but I was totally elated when I finally managed to slide the last layer into place.

> TODO: journey from 90s-45s, fast turning, quick ride down to sub-30, only Jude ahead of me. Awesome memories of team-solving. The feeling of breaking sub-20, deliberately & cognitively passing a mental barrier with how to get myself to go faster, hyper-focused.
