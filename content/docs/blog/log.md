- New Deepmind paper on Distributed Dopamine Reinforcement Learning is vv interesting
- Bumped into my old WordPress tings: https://mesenchymal.wordpress.com/
  - Dunno if I'll ever revive it. Where did I put my posts?
- Ever-increasing size of this site reminds me of numerous size of my interests...
- Occurred to me I do really want to get my URLs/lists/content out of Spotify & YouTube & Pocket & FF Bookmarks
  - Would prefer to move to content I control, store and backup myself
  - And have a git-versioned annotated repo of URLs related to topics (not just an ever-growing bin of URLs which looked kinda cool one time for reasons unknown)
