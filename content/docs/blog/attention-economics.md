# Attention Economics

Is data really the new oil? https://www.wired.com/story/no-data-is-not-the-new-oil/

No, it's attention. And we're burning the wick at both ends - attention-theft as an attack on education and the threefold social order.

## The state of the web

  - BJ Fogg
  - scrollies vs slotties: quantifying harm, comparing dimensions of cost-benefit
    - objective costs: 
      - slotties: attention, significant amts of money, time
        - for the employed 90%+ of the UK, money = attention x time
      - scrollies: attention, time, sufficient money for a phone and data connection
    - objective benefit:
      - slotties: 
        - social environment will keep some percentage of users out of even bigger trouble?
      - scrollies: 
        - information-sharing
          - personal/algorithmic recommendations channel users toward education information streams/centers
          - new possibility of global connections between scientists et al
        - generated/sustained/repaired social connections between individuals via hyperspace
        - increased mating opportunities
    - subjective cost-benefit
      - slotties:
        - random brief spikes in dopamine, declining reward system long-run
          - increased risk of substance addiction incurring greater health penalties
        - random brief spikes in bank balance, declining funds long-run
          - increased vulnerability to loan sharks and schemes to snipe those with poor credit ratings
            - costs to quality of life are incurred by poor credit rating i.e. locked out of sources of good credit
              - negative consequences of gambling addiction become 'baked-in' to the environment
              - mistake-resistance takes a long time to become a feature of environment due to requirement for repeated correct inputs of a certain class over a length of time
                - mistake-tolerance may never become a feature of brain (single lapse can trigger major and sometimes permanent capitulation)
      - scrollies:
        - social interaction generally regarded as A Very Good Thing
        - culture of sub-culture
        - amusement: lolcatz and hamburgers
  - primary profit model depends on advertising
    - advertising depends on behavioural modification
      - attention capture    
        - 'dark patterns' of UX design use addiction-research-derived visual hooks/traps
        - user-flow through system is carefully monitored and designed to induce 'vortexes', ad-view maximising behaviour hacking the users reward system, siphoning off their attention and time into the digital environment
          - metrics can be as general as time spent on website or number of visits per day
            - or as fine-grained as tracking mouse movement
    - crucial counter-factuals/questions:
      - "what is the net impact and scope on the global expenditure of attention?"
        - "what proportion of time spent by an average user on these platforms can be said to cost the user, by the users own stated preferences?"
        - "is there any a priori reason why we should not make these practices illegal tomorrow?"
- the big questions (the Faustian bargain):
  - "is it worth it for the individual?"
    - "is the advertising-driven, attention-based behaviour-modification model, which can be said to cost the user on many of the users own metrics, worth the rewards at both the general-social level and the personal metric level?"
  - "what are the costs to society?"
    - individual traits associated with social-media use/"internet addiction" aka addiction to 1 or more of the ~7-10 biggest platforms:
      - being a sheep (fully in the clutches of tribal media machine)
        - being quick to judge (a highly polarised sheep)
          - unable to comprehend the positions of those perceived to be in opposite tribes
          - reduced time/information required to generate high-confidence, highly-sticky beliefs about tribal status of person based on some social/political position
            - low-dimensional, low-entropy sub-conscious prediction network
              - trade-off: decreased accuracy for increase in speed
              - overall reduction in energy cost for at least the same reward or better 
                - tribal identification a form of (status-)anxiety reduction
              - increases in accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of incorrect states
                - behaviour in line with maintaing low entropy of belief system
                  - further polarised/clustering of graph of related beliefs
              - increases in reward can be achieved by increasing effect of reductions in status anxiety
                - in other words, increasing status anxiety by looking for threats
      - poor mental health
      - procrastination
      - decreased attention span
      - resistance to new information
      - increased number of personal goals
      - increased personal standards
      - decreased number of personal goals achieved
      - decrease in self-esteem
      - decreased initiative/problem-solving ability in realspace
        - decreased ability to function in realspace without access to hyperspace search engines
      - increased need for therapies like CBT, mindfulness/meditation
    - a form of 'attention credit' with as numerous and complex a set of trade-offs as financial credit:
      - spending of attention in sum or for individual users might otherwise spent much more productively (along both economic and social metrics)
        - which is consistent in reports of successful measures to reduce time spent on social media
      - we could be headed toward a 'bubble' created by an attention credit deficit:
        - at some point the valued we miss out on by pouring it into screens may well come back to bite us
          - advertising is inefficient but it's even more costly not to advertise 
            - any public conversion metrics?
              - it's a racket, surely.
          - the amount of absolutely giga-useless advertising (i.e. expenditure of attention that literally grants nothing for the user) must be very high
            - do users consider watching adverts a waste of time?
              - probably not, you know, it's not like it's ever enough to make a user move away from the parent media...
        - some amount of users could have invented or developed or changed or campaigned for something to improve the state of the world
        - some amount of users with highly divided attentions could have had highly focused attentions, leading to improvements to the surface of human knowledge
          - in the final analysis, what's the result of the trade-off between the increased number and intensity of sub-cultures, and decreased probability of dedication to a single sub-culture?
        - fighting against situations baked into the environments requires a constant frequency and order of inputs into the environment
          - why lots of those who escape poverty are hard-working
            - usually have a pattern of making a bunch of inputs
              - quality or scope of inputs probably doesn't matter very much
                - just have to be in some upper percentile of input-generation for an amount of time for it to stick
                - being efficient and managing time/money/speed/accuracy trade-offs probably improves probability of higher rate of future input
              - but they do have to be in the right timing and order
              - vision required - being able to see your luck, and have the preparation and nous to correctly respond
                - missed opportunities from reduced ability to perceive IRL opportunities vs increased number of opportunities overall (but occurring almost exclusively not happening IRL, instead on these social connectivity platforms)
