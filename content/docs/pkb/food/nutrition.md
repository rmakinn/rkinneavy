## Dieting

### Bulletproof

    Put butter in coffee: the no-salt kind. Milk reduces polyphenol absorption.
    High fat & veg, mid protein/carbs, low toxins/starch: eating the right fats is fine.
    MCT oil is an option if you wanna try keto
    Eat bright veg, coffee, chocolate for polyphenols, & starches like sweet potatoes, carrots, pumpkins for a good gut biome
    Short molecules oxygenate less, go for short-medium chain anti-inflammatory fats -- MCT oil, ghee, cocoa butter, krill, avo, coconut, sunflower and grass-fed butter
    gluten and soy proteins are low quality. You don't want too much protein either. Grass-fed meat is OP, grain is pointless.
        Yellower fat is healthier
        Excess protein causes inflammation because it is difficult to digest. Glucose helps your liver process protein. Sources:
            Wild fish with low mercury
            Grass fed beef/lamb
            Pastured eggs
            Hydrolyzed collagen and gelatin
            Clean whey concentrate
    The essential part of this book is avoiding processed meals and sugar: this is shit for the body, make you fat slow and weak
    These foods (via MSG etc) are designed to get you to eat more and become addicted
    Sugar crashes throw you off and lower energy, and your blood sugar level rises so much that the insulin response is strained (but it thereby decreases blood sugar). Eliminate sugar, as much as possible.
    Intermittent fasting (eating with a 6-8hr window) is popular and effective for fat loss, muscle growth, reducing cancer
    Alternate day fasting (every other day eat >2:00pm) is hard due to work. Put butter in your coffee and have that.
    Space out high-intensity workouts
        Weight training to failure lasting <20 mins is OP muscle growth (seated row, chest press)
        HIIT (fartlek) is also OP (increases anti-aging HGH btw)
        Overtraining can be harmful. You must rest between 2-10 days after each workout. Between 4-7 is ideal.
        Start with machines if you're not experienced with free weights.
    Diet affects sleep: a high fat dinner (with high DHA/Omega-3) produces serotonin which can improve sleep. Apparently raw honey is good for sleep too.
