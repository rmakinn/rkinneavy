## Pasta

### One-Pot

https://tasty.co/article/emofly/one-pot-pastas#.esDnL2rO1

## Rice

### White

Ratio rice/water: 1:1.75 

- Heat a pan to low with some oil and get the rice nice and coated: then add the water. 
  - DO NOT STIR. 
- Cover and leave for 15 minutes. 
- Uncover and replace with teatowel to absorb moisture from steam. 
  - If you want, you can add salt and pepper with the water: 
    - place cracked whole cloves on the top. Remove the cloves before serving.

### Brown

Ratio rice/water: 1:2

Bring water to boil, cook for 30 minutes, cut the flame. Cover for 5-10 minutes.

> meta is unclear. Some like loads of water. Some say bring to boil then tight cover and low for 30. Some want a teatowel cover to close. Some want steam to heat and continue absorption.

### Round

(from a self-proclaimed Japanese guy online somewhere)

Wash it till no more white water comes out and then cover it with water (the best way to know how much water to add is by dipping your index and middle finger till it reaches the first finger phalanx counting from the tip of your finger) then put it on a stove till it boils at max temp and when it hard boils lower the temperature to a minimum-medium (level 3 in a 9 level stove for example) and always cover it with your pot's top. Then boil it for 15 mins an turn the stove off and let it sit for 10 minutes, without ever stirring the rice and voila, you got some nice rice. Also add in the water a pinch or 2 of salt.

## Curries

### Green Lentil

FODMAP friendly: no onion, minimise garlic, rinse lentils thoroughly

(Figure a way of doing the spices in the onion infused oil with some substrate to start with, green tips of chives or sth)

- Tin of coconut milk
- 2 tins of green lentils
- Tomato paste
- 3 cups water
- Herbs & spices: irl coriander, ground coriander, curry powder, turmeric, cumin

- Iron pan on low-medium, heat oil
- Add spices and (whatever takes spice) -- 5min
- Then rest: lentils, tom paste, coconut milk, water 
- Bring to boil; cover and turn to low; leave for 45min

### Thai Green

#### Ingredients

2 tbsp vegetable oil
3 shallots, finely sliced
4 tbsp Thai green curry paste
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
350g butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1½ cm cubes
1 large red pepper, deseeded and cut into thick slices
400g can full fat coconut milk
5 dried kaffir lime leaves
150g mangetout
100g baby corn, halved lengthways
1 small bunch coriander, roughly chopped
cooked rice and lime wedges, to serve

#### Method

1.
Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish with a tight-fitting lid. Add the shallots with a generous pinch of salt and fry for 7-10 mins over a medium heat until softened and beginning to caramelise. Add the curry paste and chilli to the dish and fry for 2 mins. Tip in the squash and pepper, then stir through the coconut milk along with 200ml water. Add the lime leaves, cover and cook for 15-20 mins or until the squash is tender.

2.
Stir the mangetout and baby corn through the curry, then re-cover, cooking over a medium-low heat for a further 5 mins or until the veg is just cooked. Season and stir through half the coriander. Remove the lime leaves and discard. Spoon the curry into deep bowls, scatter with the remaining coriander and serve with rice and lime wedges for squeezing over.
