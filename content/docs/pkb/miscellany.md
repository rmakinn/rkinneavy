## Colours are cool

https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/

The eye reports ex nihilo random events (indistinguishable from those triggered by real photons) to the brain. The frequency of these events is dependent on the temperature. Temperature-sensitivity of biological events at this level often implies a modulation by temp of some biochemical process. In this case, the [Isomerization](:/8f26a550acb147a8b93088112689c681) of [rhodopsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin) was inferred - that is, the rearrangement of the atoms in rhodopsin molecules.
