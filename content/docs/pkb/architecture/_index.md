# Architecture

The title of this section is something of a bait. I will be including bits and bobs of my interest in your garden-variety, brick-and-mortar architecture, but I'm also interested in thinking about Human-Computer Interaction and User-Interface design as it's cousin. So the contents and sub-pages will be something of a mish-mash, but that's mostly with an aim to generate insights at best, without feeling too jarring at worst.

Below are some stubs which will eventually be developed and split out into sub-pages.

## C4 Model of Visualising Software Architecture

[Main website](https://c4model.com/)

A framework for diagramming a software system, working down the ladder of abstraction. The website itself also follows that structure to an extent, which is nice. Lots of examples helpfully placing dev-familiar technical nouns. 

1. Context - *higher-level* - how system fits into surrounding world
2. Containers - *higher-level* - connects the technical building blocks (containers)
3. Components - *lower-level* - displays the components within a block
4. Code - *lower-level* - shows how a component is implemented

## Hypercard

Invented and written by Bill Atkinson at Apple in the late 80s/early 90s. A “programming for non-programmers” environment.

> Fisher explained that “HyperCard was successful because it removed many obstacles in the way of people creating digital or interactive media”, something he reckons is missing from modern programming.
> “Our lives (social, career, entertainment) center around software -- but we are discouraged from learning how this software truly works. It is stressful at a deep level, for nearly all of us, and especially the elderly. We are made into inadequate, passive consumers, when software has the potential to be so much more.”
