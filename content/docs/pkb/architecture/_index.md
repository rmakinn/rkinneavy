# Architecture

The title of this section is something of a bait. I will be including bits and bobs of my interest in your garden-variety, brick-and-mortar architecture, but I'm also interested in thinking about Human-Computer Interaction and User-Interface design as it's cousin. So the contents and sub-pages will be something of a mish-mash, but that's mostly with an aim to generate insights at best, without feeling too jarring at worst.

Below are some stubs which will eventually be developed and split out into sub-pages.
