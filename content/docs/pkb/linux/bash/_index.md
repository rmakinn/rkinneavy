## Bash

Bash is often regarded as something of an ugly language (lots of noisy or un-intuitive syntax) with weak primitives (lacking the nice interfaces of 'grown-up' languages).

It's fair criticism, no doubt. But you'd do yourself a disservice if you knew enough about Bash to understand or share this opinion, and not also understand where it is strong, or know the role it plays in crucial software systems and networks.
