Hey watch this? Nature of Code in Rust: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3jar0tn068

Hardest parts of learning Rust:

https://naftuli.wtf/2019/03/20/rust-the-hard-parts/

Ownership & Borrowing
Enums & Pattern-Matching
Traits, Lifetimes, Generic Data Types
Strategy:

Reading/Notes:
    Keep a .rs file open for code samples; comment extensively
    Construct a .md with structure matching resource; precis/paraphrase and glossary
    Most fundamental in Anki
Anki:
    Review often; cut frequently; add more sophisticated items when thin
Practice:
    Exercises: small programming problems
    Projects: interesting choices from my Code-Projects note
    Medium: for DS/A learning
    Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1
Exercises:

https://github.com/rustlings/rustlings
    Collection of small exercises accessible in Rustplayground
Rust Cookbook: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/
    Not precisely exercises, but useful for getting shit done
    Also possibly Primary resource for DS&A
Primary Resources:

rustbook2018
    Primary initial resource for notes
Programming Rust
    Follow-up resource for more in-depth explanations
Why Rust?
    Tertiary reading material
Pain Points - Gentle Intro To Rust
    Companion to rustbook; when something doesn't go in straight away
Rust playground: https://play.rust-lang.org/
Secondary Resources:

Writing an OS in Rust: https://os.phil-opp.com/
    The author demonstrates and discusses an implementation of a small Operating System in Rust
    Probably a good resource for OS Project
Building a Rogue-like in Rust: https://jaredonline.svbtle.com/roguelike-tutorial-table-of-contents
    The author learns game-building and Rust at the same time and writes about it
aml3's Rust Tutorial: http://aml3.github.io/RustTutorial/html/toc.html
    Probably inferior to Primary entries
Rust w/ too many Linked-Lists: http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/
    Teaches Rust; then goes in depth on Linked Lists (an 'interesting' structure in Rust)
    Could be Primary when looking into DS&A and implementation in Rust
Idiomatic Rust: https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust
    List of talks discussing projects and idioms in the language
