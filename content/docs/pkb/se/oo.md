# Object-Oriented Programming

> Object-oriented design is centred around the problem definition. Objects are not real things but abstract representations of the context in which the problem will be solved. The objects manipulate the data needed to represent them without any consideration for the hardware or the real-world data patterns or quantities. This is why object-oriented design allows you to quickly build up first versions of applications, allowing you to put the first version of the design document or problem definition directly into the code, and make a quick attempt at a solution.
