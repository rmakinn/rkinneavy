# Computer Science and Software Engineering

I have the sections of CS/SE I know most about at the top-level of the PKB along with other miscellaneous topics. This section and sub-sections are to keep the top-level a little tidier: for notes on things like algorithms & data structures, the software development lifecycle etc.

Sub-sections/pages:
- Memes
  - YAGNI
  - DRY etc
- SDLC/Methodology
  - Agile/Scrum/Lean/Kanban
  - Programmer Competency Rating/Tracking
  - Documentation
  - Testing, TDD
  - Refactoring
- General Architecture Principles
  - Design patterns
  - Event-driven arch
  - Data-driven design
  - OO vs FP
  - Acronyms (see [BABEL](https://arcelect.com/babel99.htm))
    - SOLID
    - CORBA
    - CQRS
- System Design
  - Concurrency
  - Networking
  - OS, filesystem + DB internals
  - Performance constraints
  - Trade-offs
    - performance vs scaling
    - latency vs throughput
    - availability vs consistency
      - CAP theorem
- Program Design
  - RAII
  - Literate Programming

## The Art

### Learning

#### Puzzles

- freecodecamp
- project euler
- leetcode
- exercism
- hackerrank
- advent of code

### Meta

> I find that 'Strange Loop' and 'InfoQ' channels tend to post the best talks of this kind, and that the people who give the most entertaining or interesting ones are guys like Rich Hickey, Joe Armstrong, Guy Steele, Zach Tellman, Bret Victor, and Alan Kay, among others.

- ["The Mess We're In" by Joe Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4)

### Languages

* HtDP
* Composingprograms.com
* SICP
* Foundations of Programming, Seguin

#### Low-level

> C, C++, Rust
> 
> There's been a semantic shift in the meaning of the term 'low-level' from Assembly to languages like these - see the Bare-metal section below.

- The C Programming Language, K & R
- C Programming Wikibook
- The C++ Programming Language, Stroustrup

https://cgdb.github.io/

https://en.cppreference.com/w/c

#### High-level

> JS, Python, Go

#### Functional

> Clojure, Haskell
> 
> People to look out for: Erik Meijer, Philip Wadler, Rich Hickey, David Nolen, Zach Oakes, Alex Miller
> 
> Lambda World and Strange Loop, again, are the best channels for talks on this topic.

[Recursion](https://guillaumebogard.dev/blog/what-is-recursion/)

### Paradigms

#### Functional

#### Object-Oriented Design

#### Data-Oriented Design


## The Craft

> Day-to-day interactions with components of the full-stack & the resulting systems

### Tools

- git
- containers
- $EDITOR
- regex
- browsers

### Services

- AWS
- Heroku

### Front-end

### Back-end

### System Design

## The Chemistry

> What the full-stack is made of, abstractions we rely on without digging in too deep.
> 
> Naturally some overlap with the previous section - but let's be honest, not many programmers go this deep - like writing the Linux Kernel, or working on a fancy new database in Rust, or writing firmware for networking hardware or latest ARM CPU. I'm very much interested in getting a mental model of their fundamentals, but most entry-level work available to me is where the majority of modern programming is - gluing services together over REST APIs, writing CRMs, or building front-ends with a framework.
> 
> Sean Parent is really well-regarded in the C++ community and I've enjoyed some of his talks on STL and design. Also highly recommend Richard Lipp of SQLite fame. Scott Meyers for sure with C++ too.
