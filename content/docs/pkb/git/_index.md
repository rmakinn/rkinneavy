# Git

I use `git` to version code projects, interact with the hosting option of this website, and track my dotfiles - I also use it with my notes, and things like CVs and important applications.

A decent chunk of developers use `git`, and are comfortable with the basic actions like (git) `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `checkout`. They'll also view stuff with `git status -s`, `git log` and `git blame` day-to-day too. I'm not comfortable with more general commands like `merge`, `rebase`, or `stash` - and I'm unfamiliar the cornucopia of other commands `git` makes available. 

I don't have an overstanding of the underlying concepts. Asking around, it seems I'm not alone! My aim here is to summarise the technical information I can find on StackOverflow etc in fairly plain, expository prose. The distribution of explanations seems to be pretty two-tiered - one for the common-garden git commands and concepts (about 10% of those available), and another for fine-grained explanations of the remaining 90%. I'm going to have to bridge the gap -- my memory doesn't like to store things I don't [overstand]({{< relref "../language/cool-words.md#overstand" >}}) -- so I may as well record my learnings here.

## Sections

- How Git works [WIP]
  - Basic, plain-ish description of the underlying bits and pieces with plenty of out-links
- Git cheatsheet [TODO]
  - Cover the most common operations
  - Describe the less common but occasionally very useful actions, link to reference materials for when I do need to do them
