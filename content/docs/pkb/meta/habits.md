Title: "Habits"

# Habits

In my view, habits are a defining aspect of the modern zeitgeist. 

Your initial position in the matrix of metadata formed around you and your preferences was largely determined by your habits. Your habits determined your trajectory through this matrix, and the results of this measurement have been fed into economic and social systems you interact with everyday. In recent years, your habits have become silent, strong attractors of behaviour (and thought).

## Habits, how do they work?

I think a helpful analogy to understand habit-forming comes from magnetism. Think of the classic school experiment, where you're given a piece of iron and a strong magnet. When you passed the magnet over the rod in a single direction enough times, the rod became magnetised [^0]. Transfer enough energy and line up enough particles, and you've created a magnet strong enough to do the same to another rod.

### Control

- **cost**
    - spoon-theory (of depression)
    - analogies for over-pushing/over-forcing 
      - brittle things snap, non-newtonian liquid/solid response
    - working space
      - one thing at a time
    - the price of failure: bigger the pride, bigger the fall
      - new habits are like a 'direction' in your mind - a unique pole for the magnet to point toward
      - failing to maintain a positive habit is costly because the habit NOT to do something will be reinforced
        - and vice-versa
- domain & scope
    - meekness & humility: make it basic
      - simple, easy and memorable, 
      - enviro-social cues, 
      - mantras & rituals
- strategy
    - separating the goats from the sheep
    - CBT practices to help reset the landscape of possibilities for failure
      - sometimes this means you have to go deeper into your emotions
        - but oftentimes it's going too deep into your emotions (ruminating over-and-over) which is the vice
      - generally it involves writing and inspecting and expressing your thoughts in an objective manner
        - then approaching them in a balanced, honest context 
          - often social, communicative context (important to balance out your viewpoint)
            - a friendship where honesty and each others success is unselfishly valued are the best for this, I find.
            - therapy can work too. Protip: it's fine to dump your therapist if you can't express yourself, and you aren't on the same wavelength. OTOH, if you dump your therapist until you find one who just agrees with you, well, dump them too, get a journal out, and *write* your thoughts, cross out the lies, and write again, til you can be honest with yourself.

#### William James

> "1. The great thing, then, in all education, is to make our nervous system our ally instead of our enemy. It is to fund and capitalize our acquisitions, and live at ease upon the interest of the fund.
> 2. For this we must make automatic and habitual, as early as possible, as many useful actions as we can, and guard against the growing into ways that are likely to be disadvantageous to us, as we should guard against the plague. The more of the details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their own proper work.
> 3. Seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every resolution you make, and on every emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits you aspire to gain. It is not in the moment of their forming, but in the moment of their producing motor effects, that resolves and aspirations communicate the new ‘set’ to the brain.
> 4. No matter how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and no matter how good one’s sentiments may be, if one have not taken advantage of every concrete opportunity to act, one’s character may remain entirely unaffected for the better.
> 5. As a final practical maxim, relative to these habits of the will, we may, then, offer something like this: Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day. That is, be systematically ascetic or heroic in little unnecessary points, do every day or two something for no other reason than that you would rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire need draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved."
