4hr Body - Tim Ferriss:

    Minimum Effective Dose: reduce training/strainful practice to the absolute minimum required for maximum effectiveness.
    Harajuku Moment: The instant you realise you need to sort your shit out.
    Lose weight fast:
        no white carbs (bread, all rice, potatoes, pasta, tortillas, cereal)
        3 categories to stick to: major proteins (egg, beef, pork, chicken breast/thigh); legumes (black/red/soy/borlotti beans & lentils); vegetables (brocco, cauli, spinach, asparagus, peas, green beans, sauerkraut/kimchi)
        Avoid calories in milk (cow and soy etc), fruit juices, soft drinks. Lots of water, unsweetened tea/coffee. Avoid alcohol.
        Avoid fruit besides toms and avos, sugar is bad
        Let yourself have a cheat day, apparently, this increases metabolism and stimulates fat loss
        You must have a protein breakfast (>20g), don't skip (you'll overeat later when metabolism slower)
            Think eggs, cottage cheese, protein shake, some kind of meat
    Kettlebells are very effective for weight loss:
        3 sets of 5, kettlebell drop/pull
        Kettlebell pendulum, then to booty
        Do this 2-3x per week for just 15-20 min session
    For gaining muscle: try weightlifting alongside this routine
    Sex: adjust penis towards G-spot, and pelvic bone on clit
        Missionary with pillow under girls back and guy on knees works
        Increase short-term testosterone by eating cholesterol (say 4 hard-boiled eggs) night before sexytime
    Sleep troubles: try a cold bath (and ignore stupid <8hr sleep advice)
    Make sure your running technique is good:
        Build speed by leaning forward a little
        Use the balls of your feet
        Keep knees slightly bent at all times
        Use your butt over using your feet
        Try to stride 90 steps/min/leg
    Run faster by doing fast walking:
        Aim to walk 100m in 24s.
        Walk as fast as you can for 7.5min, then turn around and go back to start. Do this 2-3x/wk.
    Swim better by following good technique (maximising stroke effectiveness);
        Turn your body when you breathe in
        Look straight down, hands facing downward, fully extend arm
        Increase stroke length, not rate
        Stretch the arm that's underwater, turn body completely to side, you'll feel the stretch.
    Oh and eat cinnamon.

"As a guy, all you need to worry about are the "Big Three":
Muscle Tone
Stamina and Energy
Weight and Overall Health"

Gains in size can be acquired through myofibrilar hypertrophy (strength gains), sarcoplasmic hypertrophy (endurance gains), and through making sure your muscles are 'carbed up' because storing carbohydrates as glycogen pulls water into them, making them look full.
The following muscles will have to, at some point in your routine, be "hit" by an exercise and developed:
Shoulders and neck (deltoids and upper trapezius)
Upper arms (biceps on front, triceps on back)
Forearms (wrist flexors+extensors, finger flexors+extensors)
Back (rhomboids, upper/mid/lower trapezius, lattismus dorsii)
Chest (pectorals)
Lower back (erector spinae)
Ass (gluteus maximus)
Upper legs (hamstrings on back, quadriceps on front)
Lower legs (gastrocnemius and soleus on back, tibialis anterior on front)
You need a routine. Leg day or mixed days - no matter what, the most important thing about a schedule is giving your body the exercise it needs, but giving it resting time so it does not kill itself trying to grow.
If you're a big guy bulk up & slim down: You will do a lot of bulky weight lifting, but a bit more reps to give your muscles that extra edge, as they are probably ready to grow already. One important thing for most big people is eating right, due to the easy chance to gain weight as they build their muscles. That means a lot of vegetables and not much carbs or fat.
This means you need to do research. Go out on a limb on some good weight lifting websites and read what they have to say on the subject. Build up an exercise plan. Stick to your guns. Once you have one, just get to it- don't let yourself get lazy or easily distracted. Sometimes, it is best to do all of this with an iPod or something, just to distract yourself and let yourself build the energy up. You won't become Hercules in a year, but you will definitely see improvement if you stick to it.
Once you get this plan, find yourself a good gym to go. By "go", I don't mean "get 10 pound weights and come home". The problem with such a thing is primarily mental- you are at home, you can get distracted easily. As well, you probably can't afford the thousands of dollars worth of muscle-straining equipment you need.
Patterns:
rep lifter: count reps, but avoid patterns of laziness/habit - constantly mix things up
appeals to the spreadsheet nerd inside of me
dead lifter: lift max weights to failure
light lifter (avoid but... "if you can lift 40 pounds somewhat easily, and do exercise with 20 pounds until you can't lift, you're going to get the same result. Ripped muscle heals, regardless of whether you rip it with 40 pounds or 20 pounds. Just a thought.")
Avoid
Protein powder and supplement bs
home contraptions
snake oil
Pushups are good.
Idea: in the hr from 7-8am, can you do x pushups? 30? One every two minutes doesn't sound that hard. 60? 240?
Once you get into it, make sure you have a very low barrier of friction between you and healthy foods, and a high barrier between you and expensive foods.
Cardio! 30 minutes per day. Walking to work. Sport with cardio involved. Swimming. Yoga. Whatever.
It's usually a good strategy to wait at least one day after lifting to lift again, and it's very easy to do aerobic exercises that day. Also, if you learn to work through the pain and burn during a strenuous aerobic exercise, the increased pain tolerance can help you push yourself during weight training. In addition, aerobic exercise will help you just in everyday life. Most notably, you'll be more attractive; you'll lose weight. Like it or not, most people prefer skinny to fat. Also, being able to walk up a flight of stairs or run after the bus without losing your breath is a very nice thing.
Also, try to find a running partner. It's much easier to stick to your exercise if you exercise with someone. Also, it's more fun.
C25K is a good plan to spin up a habit. Pace yourself
Treadmills can be useful but boring. Bolehills. HIIT (once you're in the habit).
