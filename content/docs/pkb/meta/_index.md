# Meta

{{< hint info >}}
A catch-all place to talk about 'the meta' in the gaming usage of the term. You could say the rest of this PKB explicates rules of 'the game' - this section is about the conventions of play.
{{< /hint >}}

*By 'the game', I mean the whole thing, in the absurd abstract*:

> You're a mind piloting a meat-suit around, and the meat-suit needs to be continually re-fuelled, lie dormant a third of the time, and reproduce. It turns out evolutionary forces interfacing with a self-reinforcing loop of genetically and culturally transmitted behaviour has culminated in this thing called 'conscious thought'... An emergent quality which seems to endow the ability to consider it's own processes, exercise deliberate memory access, and maintain a notion of identity (even before and after going to sleep!).

The motivation for this section is that I want somewhere to talk about *how* to manage the peculiar reality of this situation we find ourselves in -- the **meta** -- from tips for looking after the quality of ones sleep, to ways of understanding psychiatry, to useful life-hacks. I want to talk about how to do academic-style research and OSINT-style search. I want somewhere to post old fun articles about money-management or League of Legends or whatever without polluting the sidebar.

Loads of blogs on things like productivity and money management milk their subject matter for all it's worth, 'dog-fooding' content into the minimally-acceptable package to maintain or grow viewership, while maximising ad-surface or sponsorship opportunities.

*I don't think there's anything wrong with that*, I just think it's good to keep them honest by saying it straight up. Some of us are a little naïve than others. I myself have gone through phases obsessing over 'how to use [**x** *productivity system*] with [**y** *fancy application*]' - taking everything said at face value, lapping up the secret answers to problems I never knew I had. I'd consistently end up with a jumbled picture of contradictory and unhelpful concepts, and heaps of guilt over either A), my procrastination on something so convoluted and shallow, or even worse B), my inability to adhere to these 'philosophies'.

## TL;DR: Productivity Strats

### GTD

> Goal is to reduce detritus in your working memory over stuff you have to do, and get it out there on the page into something that can be managed. Pick a simple manner of implementation for brain dump. Learn a couple of management/trimming habits. Get routine. Rinse/repeat/refine.

Have a central place for storing and dumping all your thoughts about doing stuff (what, how, whom, when, must/maybe do). Structure by place/context, person/occasion, and divide projects into things like 'next task', 'waiting for'. Periodically review and trim/delegate/complete short tasks. 

Steps:
1. Capture
2. Clarify
3. Organise
4. Reflect
5. Engage

### Pomodoro

Time yourself working for 25 minute periods. Give yourself a 5 minute break between periods, and a longer 15-minute-ish break every few.

## Information Retrieval

> "The science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds."
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval)

["As We May Think"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think) by [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush)

### Search-engines

- I use Google a lot, like everyone else, but I'm not always that happy about it [*], and the quality gets objectively worse year-on-year. Alternatives:
  - [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
    - Often use this instead of Google. 
    - Private, no tracking, results are usually very good, sometimes better than Google.
      - Doesn't 'search what we think you mean, not what you said', which can be good and bad
    - Supports pretty extensive query syntax and [!bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) are an awesome feature.
      - I.E. '!w websearch' = directly search Wikipedia from DDG interface
  - [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)
    - Privacy-oriented, based in Netherlands
    - Probably the best besides Google/DDG imo
  - [Swisscows](https://swisscows.com/)
    - Another privacy-oriented search engine, based in Switzerland
  - [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/?l=en)
    - Aaand yet another privacy-oriented search engine, based in France
  - [Searx](http://asciimoo.github.io/searx/)
    - The most 'hard-core' privacy-focused search engine in this list:
      - "a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from more than 70 search services. Users are neither tracked nor profiled. Additionally, searx can be used over Tor for online anonymity."
  - [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en)
    - Eco-friendly, plant some trees.

    - "[...] finding things you didn't know you wanted to know, which was the real joy of web surfing, no longer happens [...]. The Wiby search engine is building a web of pages as it was in the earlier days of the internet. In addition, Wiby helps vintage computers to continue browsing the web, as page results are more suitable for their performance."

    - "Million Short makes it easy to discover sites that just don't make it to the top of the search engine results for whatever reason – whether it be poor SEO, new site, small marketing budget, or competitive keywords"

### Web Directories, Wikis & Cyclopedias

- [Etymology Online](https://www.etymonline.com/)
- [Curlie](https://curlie.org/)
  - One of the last surviving web directories, and surprisingly decent
  - Public and explorable ontologies of the web/web content are important, I think
- [Webopedia](https://www.webopedia.com/)
  - Online tech dictionary for IT professionals
- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)
