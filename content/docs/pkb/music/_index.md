## Circle of Fifths

## Intro

The main point of circle of fifths is to organize the keys based on how many sharps/flats they have in the key signature. That's it.



## Core

Sharp: Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle

Flat: Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles Father

That's the order of fifths, and it always stays the same. The next fifth after B is F#, and after that the order is the same, but there is a sharp in front of all of the notes (so F# C# G# D#, etc.). When you go in the flat direction, the next key from F is Bb, and after that the order is the same but there is a flat in front of all of the notes (and obviously in the flat direction you read it backwards, so Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb). That's really it. Remember that C major and A minor are the keys that have no sharps or flats. After that you always count one fifth up to get the key that has one more sharp (or one less flat) in the key signature, and one fifth down to get the key that has one more flat (or one less sharp) in the key signature.

## Elaboration

There's also a circle of fourths: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEF41VPcrY

The latter is considered more useful, here's an explanation why:

> First off, the circle of fifths is an incorrect mental representation of what is actually going on when organizing keys into some semblance of order. It is better to organize the keys clockwise by fourths, calling it instead the circle of fourths.

> Once you have that in mind the organization becomes apparent when you look at V - I relationships. Putting all the keys into this cycle of fourths means each clock position is a Dominant to Tonic relationship. You can take this further by going two clock positions. Now its a subdominant ii chord, Dominant V, Tonic cadence. Or when you move from a Tonic, put a flat 7 on it, call it the V of IV, now you have another cadence. If jazz is your thing, four clock positions is a iii VI ii V I.

> Since music theory is a active theory, not to be debated over coffee, any extra elements that don't help you immediately get to what you need improvisation or composition wise will hinder your progress.

> This organization also helps with the sharps and flats. The sharp you take away or the flat you add will always be the leading tone or seven scale degree of the current key, which is related to the V of IV to IV (or new Tonic chord if a tonicization or modulation is your goal). This again is by moving one clock position.
