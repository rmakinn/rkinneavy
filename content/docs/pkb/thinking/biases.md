Sections to do:

- Hasty norms/generalisations

## Certainty Effect

> When people overweight outcomes that are considered certain relative to outcomes that are merely possible.
> The certainty effect makes people prefer 100% as a reference point relative to other percentages, even though 100% may be an illusion of certainty. Lower percentages or probabilities can be more beneficial in the long run.
> For example, people prefer a 100% discount on a cup of coffee every 10 days to other more frequent but lower discount offer, even though the second option may save them more money in the long run.

## Availability/recency

> A mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person’s mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision.
> People tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward the latest news.

## Anchoring

> A cognitive bias that describes the human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the “anchor”) when making decisions.
> For example, an initial price offered for a used car sets the standard for the rest of the negotiation.

## Gut bias

> A mental shortcut that allows people to make decisions quickly by bringing their emotional response into play. They make decisions according to their gut feeling.
> Researchers have found that when people have a pleasant feeling about something, they see the benefits as high and the risks as low, and vice versa.
> As such, the affect heuristic behaves as a first and fast response mechanism in decision-making.
> For example, if someone has harmed you, you quickly arrive at the conclusion that this person is cold and unfriendly. If fact, even if the person didn’t harm you on purpose, you may still think about him or her the same.

## Bounded rationality

> The idea that in decision-making, people are limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite time. As a result, they seek for a “good enough” decision and tend to make a satisficing (rather than maximizing or optimizing) choice.
> For example, during shopping when people buy something that they find acceptable, although that may not necessarily be their optimal choice.
