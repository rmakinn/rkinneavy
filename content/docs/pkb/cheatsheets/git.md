# Git Cheatsheet

## Set up machine so you don't have to type user/pwd all the time

## Turn a local directory into a Git repo

`git init`

## Clone a git repo from a URL to a local directory

`git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2`

That creates a directory named libgit2, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new libgit2 directory that was just created, youâ€™ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.

## Stage (add) a file

`git add {filename}`

### Add all markdown files

`git add *.md`

### Add all in $(cwd)

`git add .`

## Commit staged (added) files

`git commit -m "{commit message}"`

## Remote repos

### Push to

### Pull from
