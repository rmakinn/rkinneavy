Goals:

    To accurately and consistently solve 333BLD in <1min (top 5%)
    To improve self-confidence in learning new tricks
    To find a system to apply PAO in and grow from there


Memo method:

    Corners -> CP/CP -> Audio system (ralawa kataba)
    Edges -> Speffz lettering or system-based letters? I don't find Speffz intuitive
        Use PAO/similar?


Exec method:

    Edges -> M2+ (M2 with additional algs/comms)
    Corners -> Turbo/comms


Learning method:

    Corners -> Excel for memo/algorithms -> table of pieces | colours | sounds | algorithms
    Edges -> as above
    Anki: take chunks of this reference table and put into Anki
    PAO: find ways of utilising PAO in the rest of life, not just cube memo.


Practice method:

    Substeps individually
            Edges memo
            Corners memo
            Corners exec
            Edges exec
        I.e. EM -> EE // CM -> CE // EM -> interference/time -> EE
        Train for speed, then accuracy, then both
        Inchworm theory: tag solves as A/B/C-game, look for patterns of difficulty/excellence, move B forward by shoring up C and pushing out A
    Playing around and having fun:
        Discovery is one of the most enjoyable aspects, cultivate that
        Try and do silly things like memorise in the morning and execute that night (or memo before sleep and exec after wake)
