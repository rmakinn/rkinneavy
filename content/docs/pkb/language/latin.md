# Latin

[Wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Latin_language)

I fancy learning a bit of Latin as it's something of a 'glue' between many modern natural languages. I am highly conscious of the limitations of speaking just a single language, and yet I don't envisage *needing* to learn one any time soon - even if I moved to Europe for work, many Europeans speak English at least well enough for me to get by with basic knowledge.

So lacking a sufficiently different and appropriate environment for foreign language-learning [*], I may as well pick a language which instead integrates with my environment, and whose meaning and relevance resurfaces as I consider words in a new light. 

My thinking is it will generate something of a connective tissue, a myelination of the circuitry required, a knowledge of the 'word stems' should I ever get the opportunity to learn a new, Latin-related language (probably German or Spanish?).

[*] meaningful, relevant, immersive, high-feedback application and recall
