# Cool words

Here's a list of cool/unusual words, I'll try to remember to link to them here when I use them.

## Overstand

{{< hint info >}}
In my usage, it means to have a complete and intuitive comprehension of something from an authoritative position. It goes in contrast[0] with *understanding* - where *under-* implies a servile position on the topic. Overstanding also has political and spiritual connotations of freedom and liberation.

> To overstand is to comprehend a thing itself AND to have knowledge of why it is the way it is and of its place or role in the grand scheme of things

Originating from Rastafarianism and spread via hip-hop culture, I first learned this word when reading a Ben Harper interview in a guitar magazine probably fifteen-plus years ago. It's a very rich word, with deep roots in Rastafari philosophy[1]. It caught my imagination immediately, and became an important component of my way of thinking about the world.

I think of understanding as maintaining a vulgar representation in your mind, one that needs updating and frequent *recomputing* as you **track** the idea. 

Whereas *overstanding*, in my mind, is what you have when you achieve a position of **mastery** over an idea - where you can **predict** where it will go and how it will **behave**. 

One symptom is you can dive from a mile-high general overview of the idea all the way down to the sentence-detail, where you can read between the lines. Another symptom is that you generate new context-appropriate metaphors as you communicate about it internally or with others - in contrast to re-using or leaning on old 'crutch' metaphors.

> It is overstood that when one communicates, they are communicating an idea to another individual. Ideas are created by men thus the idea cannot be superior to its creator; similarly to the concept (I-cept) held by the Islamic ideology that man cannot be God because God created man.
> The Rastafari philosophy asserts that every man woman and child are equal (hence the term InI) therefore the individual who is receiving the information is equal to the communicator of the information and superior to the idea being communicated. That being said, one should not “understand” or stand under an idea; when they absorb and correctly perceive an idea they “Overstand” it.

## Mesenchyme

{{< hint info >}}
A type of connective tissue found mostly during embryonic development of bilateral animals (triploblasts). It is composed mainly of ground substance with few cells or fibers. It can also refer to a group of mucoproteins resembling mucus found, for example, in certain types of cysts. It is most easily found as a component of Wharton's jelly.

In other words, an **embryologically primitive "soup"** -- and a personal word that helps my perception, reminding me of the Buddhist concept of a dynamic **impermanance**. I think of it as a more general application of an idiomatic usage of pregnant, i.e. "a mind pregnant with ideas". Don't think I've ever used it in conversation.

I'm still learning about Buddhism, but I think my underlying concept roughly aligns with [Samskara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)) and/or the Pali [*Saṅkhāra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%85kh%C4%81ra) (सङ्खार).

> Sometimes it is unhelpful or unskillful to interact with things as 'objects and atoms' - things which have notions or 'buckets' like properties or ends or determinacy. It can be much more appropriate [*] to collect related things with a manner and aim which acknowledges uncertainty and potential, and doesn't expect clear delineation or upcoming application.

In some sense it also relates to [Matthew 7:24-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A24-27&version=KJV):

> **24** Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
>
> **25** And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
>
> **26** And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
>
> **27** And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

We are often so busy finding and assigning resources for the continual building of little houses -- houses for events and bits of information or ideas -- that we won't spare a thought to determine if our energies are better saved than spent.

A loosely-connected idea is that of top-down control versus bottom-up approaches - [Soviet central planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet-type_economic_planning) compared to anarchic markets.

Things apropos of mesenchymal: 

- an emotional connection with another person
- a mental 'set' or physical environment
- a moment of ideation or inspiration
- a file full of lines of prose or code
- a document with a single word written at a certain time
- observing yourself attending to a response to an emotion

[*] and often less cognitively expensive
